    <!-- ABOUT HOMEMADE CORN DOGS -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, <br>
    coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, <br>
    the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.

    <!-- HOMEMADE CORN DOGS INGREDIENTS -->
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cornmeal and flour:</strong> This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and pepper:</strong>Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
        <li><strong>beef frankfurters</strong>This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
    </ul>
